# Foreword
Hi! üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

First, thanks for making the time for this challenge! We appreciate it.

## What should you build?

Design a small Next.js app using the icanhazdadjoke.com API.

The app's main page should show a random joke, together with a button to get another random joke from the api. Also users can like the joke and share it with a permanent link.

When the user likes a joke, that joke is saved so the user can see the list of saved jokes anytime.

The jokes list: 

- Displays all jokes saved by the user
- The user can remove the joke from the list
- The user can search for any joke in the list by typing free text
- The user can sort this list so he can put the jokes he likes the most first.
- The user can get a permanent link to the joke for sharing

For saving data use something local, maybe cookies, local storage, or something else. But don't use anything on the server side.

For the UI, use either tailwind CSS or Material UI.

## Notes

Add a README with everything you consider necessary to run the app

If you make any assumptions, take note of them in the README, so we can better understand your decisions.

We are open to questions if you have any doubts
